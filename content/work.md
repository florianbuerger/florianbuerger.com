# Is this you?

If you see yourself in one of the statements above, please [contact me](mailto:florian@florianbuerger.com?subject=Project inquiry). I will help you to bring that idea to life, advise you how your app could be improved or help your engineering team with the implementation.

I developed apps full time for the Apple platform since the first release of iPhone. Back then, iOS was called iPhone OS, and web apps were the ‚Äúsweet solution‚Äù for apps on iPhone, just to put the time frame into perspective.

I am available for iOS and macOS development as well as any kind of software design. As I am learning other platforms as well, I will take on smaller web front-end or Android projects.

# FAQ

## How can I get in touch with you?

I'm [@florianbuerger](https://twitter.com/florianbuerger) on Twitter. You can [email me](mailto:florian@florianbuerger.com?subject=Hire) or send an iMessage to `florian@florianbuerger.com`.

## How much do you charge?

My rate is `80‚Ç¨`/hour or `3,000‚Ç¨`/week for short term projects or smaller chunks of work. If you need more work done, contact me, and I am sure we can work something out.

## What technologies do you use?

I tend to stick to Apple iOS architecture guidelines as close as possible. Sometimes it may not be the most elegant solution, but it gets the job done and minimizes maintenance work in future OS releases.

In the end, it does not really matter what technology is used to solve a problem. The important thing is the problem is solved and the user is happy with the solution. The user does not care about implementation details.

## Can you design?

Yes, I am happy to help there as well. Most of the time I work in Sketch or Affinity Designer but if you or your client require Adobe Photoshop that is okay too. If you need illustration work, my [lovely wife](https://www.verenaortlieb.com) should join the project.

## Will you use any cross-platform technologies?

No, I am only coding natively in Swift and Objective-C. I am willing to look at [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) if you can make a reeeaally compelling case for it.

## Where are you located?

My business is registered in Germany, but currently, I am traveling the world with my wife. I am willing to adopt your time zone for meetings or pair programming sessions if required.

## Legal

You need to sign my consulting agreement. It has an NDA agreement included. <!-- [Here is a sample](/share/sample-agreement.pdf) of what this agreement could look like. -->

## That's it

[Email me](mailto:hi@florianbuerger.com?subject=Hire) and I am sure we can work something out. I am looking forward to hearing from you!
